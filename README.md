**Programmer’s guide to data science using ML.NET, OpenAI, and Semantic Kernel**

## What is this book about?
This book presents a hands-on learning approach to data science, machine learning, generative AI, and AI orchestration by guiding you through various experiments using Polyglot Notebooks.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Load, analyze, and transform data using DataFrames, data visualization, and descriptive statistics
* Train machine learning models with ML.NET for classification and regression tasks
* Customize ML.NET model training pipelines with AutoML, transforms, and model trainers
* Apply best practices for deploying models and monitoring their performance
* Connect to generative AI models using Polyglot Notebooks
* Chain together complex AI tasks with AI orchestration, RAG, and Semantic Kernel
* Create interactive online documentation with Mermaid charts and GitHub Codespaces

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
ExperimentResult<MulticlassClassificationMetrics> result =
 exp.Execute(split.TrainSet, split.TestSet);
ITransformer model = result.BestRun.Model;
var metrics = result.BestRun.ValidationMetrics;
metrics.ConfusionMatrix.GetFormattedConfusionTable()
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for experienced C# or F# developers who want to transition into data science and machine learning while leveraging their .NET expertise. It’s ideal for those looking to learn ML.NET and Semantic kernel and extend their .NET skills to data science, machine learning, and Generative AI Workflows.
